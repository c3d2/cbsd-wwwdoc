<div class="warning">
	<p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
	<p>When a new jail is created or obtaining from the repository, make it a rule ALWAYS change the user's password <strong>root</strong> in jail, even if you do not plan to run it ssh/ftp/rsh and similar services. If the jail is created with applytpl=0, by default <em>/etc/{passwd,master.passwd,group}</em> in the jail as the original "clean" files FreeBSD, so password of <strong>root</strong> user is empty.  If jail created with applytpl=1 (it also refers to images from repository) <em>$workdir/share/jail-skel</em> files will be used as templates where root password is <strong>'cbsd'</strong> in default <strong>CBSD</strong> installation. You can change default root password when new jail is created via edit of hash in skel master.passwd via:
	<p>% vipw -d ${workdir}/share/jail-skel/etc</p>
	<p>commands, or specify alternative path to jail-skel dir in .jconf (jcreate tools) config</p>
