	<h1><span>About the project</span></h1>
	<div class="block">
		<p><strong>CBSD</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;management layer written for the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a> <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&amp;sektion=8" target="_blank">jail(8)</a> subsystem,
		<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;sektion=8" target="_blank">bhyve</a> and <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/">Xen</a>.
		The project is positioned as a single integrated tool of comprehensive solution for building and deploying virtual environments quickly with pre-defined software sets with minimal configuration.</p>
		<p>No&nbsp;extra&nbsp;OS functionality has been exposed yet, and everything that <strong>CBSD</strong> can&nbsp;do, you could also run manually with tens or&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;commands in&nbsp;the CLI using the underlying utilities (Not that you would want&nbsp;to!)</p>

	<h2><a name="why">Why&hellip;</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p><p><strong>Q:</strong> &laquo;Why FreeBSD?:</p>
		<p>
			<li>
			According to the authors of the project, Linux is no longer a member of the common people,
			it is fully controlled by big commercial organization. while FreeBSD is developed mostly by  enthusiasts. 
			Today, Linux - it is a commercial machine for making money - is that it was Microsoft Windows in 90 years.
			While many Linux users have struggled against the Windows monopoly (CBSD author of one of them).
			Yes, FreeVSD very far behind in their characteristics in comparing to Linux.
			Just look at the abundance of such powerfull decisions as the <strong>OpenVZ, LXD, Ceph, GlusterFS, OpenNebula, OpenStack, Proxmox, ISPPanel</strong> and a dozen others. 
			On FreeBSD nothing like this or it does not work.
			Therefore, the choice of FreeBSD as a platform for us - it is one of the attempts at least 
			something to try to improve in FreeBSD: Linux is saturated with similar solutions.
			We all love independence and freedom and FreeBSD today - an independent and free 
			operating system, which is in the hands of ordinary people.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Q:</strong> &laquo;Why CBSD written on <strong>sh</strong>:</p>
		<li>
		<p>Most of&nbsp;the code has been written in&nbsp;<strong>sh</strong>, 
		since there are no&nbsp;demands for complex logic  (<a href="/de/cbsdsh.html">details</a>) 
		- CBSD core should be considered as shell-command backend, which is achieved is necessary and in case of problems, 
		any system engineer can always locate and correct the problem in the code. 
		The rest, more complex components CBSD (eg, a Frontend, which implements RestAPI for interfaces) 
		written in a language go, nodejs, php, and is not part of CBSD.</li></p>

	<div class="block">
	<p>
	<p>Work on the <strong>CBSD Project</strong> largely depends on the following factors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The availability of free time outside the daily job (the project is not a commercial): working on CBSD, we sacrifice their time to rest and to communicate with family and friends;</li>
		<li>On the demand for the project;</li>
		<li>From the proposals relating to the using part of CBSD or the development and adaptation CBSD components for real / commercial projects;</li>
	</ul>
